# Singly Linked List
  - we created a singly linked list with associated methods

## Challenge
  - we created functions to insert into a linked list, check what it includes, and render it as a string

## Approach and Efficiency
  - I created  linked list that used the built-in str method and while loops
  - Big O space:
  - Big O time:

## API
  - this has 3 methods: insert, includes, and render as string
