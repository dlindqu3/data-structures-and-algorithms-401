# Trees
- binary search trees work by constantly dividing the data in half

## Challenge
- see if a binary search tree contains a value, and add a value


## Approach & Efficiency
- for the "add" method, I created a helper function
- for the "contains" method, I used conditionals and a while loop
- Big O time: O(logN)
- Big O space: O(1)

## API
- available methods: contains, add
