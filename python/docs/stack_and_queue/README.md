# Stacks and Queues
- I have created a basic stack and a basic queue

## Challenge
- I have implemented a stack with these methods: push, pop, peek, isEmpty
- I have implemented a queue with these methods: enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, peek

## Approach & Efficiency
- I used conditionals and no loops in my implementations
- stack Big O:
  - time: O(1)
  - space: O(N)
- queue Big O:
  - time: O(1)
  - space: O(N)

## API
- Stack:
  - push adds an element to the top
  - pop removes from top
  - peek shows item at top
  - isEmpty returns a boolean
- Queue:
  - enqueue adds an item at end of queue
  - dequeue removes from front
  - isEmpty returns boolean
  - peek returns front
