# Graphs
- create a graph data structure, built using a python dictionary under the hood

## Challenge
- build a graph class with the methods add_node, size, get_nodes, add_edge, and get_neighbors


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- I used python's built-in dictionary/hashtable to store values for each vertex's adjacent points
- all other methods and classes are standalone and do not inherit from other structures
- Big O time: O(N)
- Big O space: O(N)
