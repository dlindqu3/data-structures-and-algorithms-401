# Trees
- return arrays of the items in a tree in order, using one of three methods

## Challenge
- the three methods search through the tree are pre_order (root-left-right), in_order (left-root-right), and post_order (left-right-root)

## Approach & Efficiency
- Approach - I used loops and conditionals
-Big O space: O(N)
-Big O time: )(N)

## API
- methods: pre-order, in-order, post-order
