- For this challenge, we 1 method that finds the value that is "k" indeces from the end of the linked list

## Whiteboard Process
![whiteboard image here]()

## Approach and Efficiency
- I created a "count" variable in the overall LinkedList class variable space, and added to it each time an item was added to the linked list. Then, I used that value along with "K" to find the index of the correct node/value

- Big O time:
  - kth_from_end: O(N)
- Big O space: O(N)

## Solution
- see the "linked_list.py" file
